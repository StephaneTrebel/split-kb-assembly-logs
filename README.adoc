This file will document my build process of the Aurora Lily48 split keyboard

TODO: Document content (board, switches, etc.)

= Day 1 - May 4h (be with you) 2024

13h40: Unpacking everything !

14h08: After some doc reading (again !), we start with diodes
In my case I *have* to solder diodes from the bottom side to ensure the top side will have as few protruding tin as possible.

Using jewel tweezers is helpful for bending diode legs !

Better do them 10-15 at a time to be efficient

15h: done bending and installing diodes ! phew !

Since I Have to solder on the bottom side (on the diode side) to avoid tin on the top side (which would hinder plate placement),
it's better to have every diode placed so that the plate is "hovering" when soldering

15h15 début soudure diodes
15h26: fin première plaque
15h35: fin soudures diodes !
15h56: cleanup and done !
